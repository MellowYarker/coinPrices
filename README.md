# Usage
To start the server, run `python3 run_app.py`.

It will print out the process IDs for `crawler.py` and `server.py`.
To shut the server and crawler down, just hit the program with sigint via `ctrl + c`, or kill the processes
manually using the PIDs printed earlier.

Next, open `index.html` in your browser to view the webpage.
